## Rahul Morabiya's Project Repository

Welcome to my project repository! This repository contains a collection of projects that I've worked on, showcasing my skills in software development, machine learning, web development, and data science. Each project is organized into its own directory with all the necessary files, including code, documentation, and any related resources.

Projects Overview
1. SpaceX Rocket Landing Prediction
Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook
Description:
This project involves analyzing Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch data to develop predictive models for rocket landing success. Various machine learning models, including SVM, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression, were evaluated. The best model was deployed on a Dash web application for interactive visualization and predictions.

Key Features:

  Data analysis and preprocessing
  Model training and evaluation
  Deployment on a web application using Dash

2. Hotel Booking App
Technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Cloudinary, TypeScript
Description:

Key Features:

  Secure authentication with HTTP cookies and JWT
  Image uploads for hotel listings
  Advanced search, sort, and filter functionalities
  Automated end-to-end testing

3. YouTube App
Technologies: JavaScript, RapidAPI, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Material-UI
Description:
A YouTube clone application developed with RapidAPI for seamless data integration. This project features video playback, robust search functionality, and tag-based filtering, all wrapped in a responsive design using Material UI components.

Key Features:

  Video playback and search functionality
  Tag-based filtering for video content
  Responsive design with Material UI
  Deployed on Netlify for optimized performance


4. Lung Cancer Detection with Federated Learning Algorithms & ResNet Model
Technologies: Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Kaggle
Description:
This project focuses on creating a framework for lung cancer detection using deep learning and federated learning algorithms. By implementing ResNet152V2 for image classification, the project achieves significant accuracy in detecting lung cancer, with comparisons across different federated learning algorithms.

Key Features:

Implementation of Federated Learning algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad)
Use of ResNet152V2 neural network for image classification
Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and AUC
Achieved 89% accuracy with federated models
